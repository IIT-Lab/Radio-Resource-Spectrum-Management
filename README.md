## Radio Resource and Spectrum Management
In Mobile Communication Systems, the radio spectrum is a limited natural resource which is shared between systems and UEs, for this reason, the radio resources must be allocated properly and scheduled according to the network conditions.

This repository shows some of the codes I implemented for the course Radio Resource Spectrum Management at Aalto Univeristy and is focused on the problems related to sharing of radio resources between users within single system (Radio Resource Management) and sharing of the spectrum between systems (Spectrum Management), covering the following topics:


* [Frequency band selection](frequency-selection)
	In this code I analyze two frequency selection strategies using Montecarlo simulation with 200 snapshots in the scenario where there are four frequency bands (2.6 GHz, 2.1 GHz, 1.8 GHz and 900 MHz).
